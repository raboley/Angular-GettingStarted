# First Things First

## Installing an Angular Application

[package.json](./package.json) is a file that stores all the packages and versions needed to run the project. These packages can be run by executing

````bash
npm install
````

in the same folder. Visual studio code has a nice feature where it will allow you to right click open in terminal from the same folder making this very easy.
